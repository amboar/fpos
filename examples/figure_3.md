Expenses per Month
==================

![Expenses per Month](figure_3.png)

A straight box-plot of expenses per-category per month. The incomplete month is
not considered as it will generate outrider values (usually lower), as such
each category will contain up to 11 data points.

A table is provided below the box-plot showing the statistical values
describing the distribution derived from the data in each category.
