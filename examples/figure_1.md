Expenditure by Category per Month
=================================

![Expenditure by Category per Month](figure_1.png)

The graph is a stacked bar chart, with months on the X axis and dollars on the
Y axis. The custom used through `fpos` graphs is to represent expenses as
negative and income as positive values. As this plot concerns expenses, the Y
axis shows negative values. The tip of the stacked bar chart represents the
sum of expenses in the month. Note that the right-most stacked bar represents
the current month, which is almost always incomplete.

Different spending categories are represented by (a terrible choice of)
different colours. The map between colours and categorise is documented in the
table below the graph, which contains the expense values used to derive the
bars.

The graph aims to give a feeling for how the cumulative spending tracks
month-to-month, whilst also trying to show the impacts of each category's
expenses inside a given month. Visually it's a little difficult to compare
categories month-to-month, but this representation was prefered over discarding
the absolute spending values (and using pie charts). To compare spending
month-to-month for a given category, refer to the graph of [Monthly Expenditure
per Category](figure_4.md)
